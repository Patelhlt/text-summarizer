ArXiv and PubMed Datasets: Available via Hugging Face Datasets
I found a dataset in Hugging Face Datasets - ArXiv and PubMed are both distribution service for research articles:

ArXic:arXiv is primarily an archive and distribution service for research articles. arXiv provides support for data sets and other ancillary materials only in direct connection with research articles submitted.arXiv offers researchers a broad range of services: article submission, compilation, production, retrieval, search and discovery, web distribution for human readers, and API access for machines, together with content curation and preservation. arXiv supports the inclusion of ancillary files of modest size with articles.


PubMed:The PubMed database contains more than 37 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature. It does not include full text journal articles; however, links to the full text are often present when available from other sources, such as the publisher's website or PubMed Central (PMC).PubMed offers a broad overview of existing literature on a particular topic and is arguably more comprehensive than any other database when it comes to biomedical topics.
